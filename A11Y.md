- Screen Reader Compatibility:
    - Aria labels and descriptions have been added throughout the site with aria-labelledby, aria-label, aria-describedby, and aria-live attributes to provide clear navigation cues for screen readers.
    - Hidden descriptions have also been included to in HiddenDescription components for input fields helping describe the input fields purpose and usage like the tab function in the code block in the edit presentation screen. This ensures that screen readers convey this information accurately.
    - All images have alt texts to improve accessability for screen readers and users to know the image if it fails to load.
    
- Keyboard Navigation:
    - Tab and Esc key support has been implemented helping with keyboard navigation. All fields are accessible through tabs and modal and error messages may be closed with the esc key improving and allowing a seamless keyboard-based navigation.
    - Enter key support has been provided on most forms like login, registration, new presentation creation etc where you dont have to click on the submit button to submit but may opt to press enter when the final field of hte form is filled.

- Error Messaging:
    - A live region for errors has been set up using aria-live="assertive" for the error display to notify screen reader users immediately of validation issues, ensuring that input errors are immediately announced and easily corrected.
    - Error messages are dismissed automatically on a 5 sec timer, giving enough time to read/understand the message but disappear before becoming distracting.
    - Error messages are descriptive providing users with the exact issue causing the failed validation.

- Input Field Accessibility:
    - Sematic labels and tags are used appropriately, improving reability for screen readers and further the use of label elements with htmlFor attributes to link form labels to their respective input fields aid both screen readers and keyboard navigation by explicitly associating each label with its input.
    - Autocomplete fields have been enabled on login and registeration forms to improve useability and accessibility to the site.
    - Meaningful placeholder messages have been set up on all input fields guiding users on how to fill in the modal forms.
