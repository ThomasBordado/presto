- Clear Visual Hierarchy:
    - The site uses clear headings, form labels, and spacing to establish a strong visual hierarchy which makes the interface more intuitive and helps users find what they want. For example our modals are styled so that FormTitle and FormLabel components are styled to differentiate key areas in the form, helping guide users to fill in the information.
    - Forms have been organised in a logical order, grouping related fields (e.g., code content, font size, dimensions) to match the user's mental model of task completion reducing cognitive load and helping complete the form easier.
    
- Accessible and Descriptive Texts:
    - The site also provides informative placeholder text and accessible descriptions for input fields helping users understand what each field requires without additional guidance. For example, the code editor’s placeholder text clarifies that the user can press “Tab” for indentation, which is especially helpful in preventing user error and indicates a different functionality to the keyboard navigation the tab key was used for.
    
- Consistent and Simple Style:
    - The site was designed to be simple and consistent. For example, buttons have consistent styling, such as the SubmitButton, which uses color transitions and a hover effect to provide visual feedback. This is mirrored across the site helping build familiarity and thus allowing users to easily identify actionable elements. This has also been extended to other interactable fields, having similar darking effects on hover, change of cursor to pointer indicating a clickable behaviour, or an highlighting outline on an input field indicating you can click and input data or that the field is active.
    
- Focus Management:
    - When adding or editing content, the site uses a modal that is centered and highlighted by dimming the background to focus the users attention on the modal, making it clear that this is the current point of interaction
    - The zIndex has been used correctly to help users know which elements are of most importance or are currently interactable. Error messages take priority hence they have the highest zIndex followed by modals and the interactive content box in the edit presentation page.
    
- Responsive Design for Flexibility:
    - The pages have been optimised to provide a responsive and dynamic design to accommodate different screen sizes and devices. This helps maintain a user friendly interface across devices without sacrificing clarity or functionality.
    - We decided small screen sizes were going to be users on mobile devices or tablets thus enabling users to rotate screens. Hence to maintain a functional screen tht wasnt too compact we rotated the screen. This is seen in how the preview page reacts to small windows. 
    
- WCAG Standards:
    - The site uses consistent font families (Arial, sans-serif) and a cohesive color palette that aligns with accessibility standards. It has been ensured that all elements meet AA standard at minimum helping create visually harmonious and easy-to-read interface.
